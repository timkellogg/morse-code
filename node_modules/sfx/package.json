Ever just wanted your error messages read out? `node-sfx` is for you.\n\n### Install\nInstall `sfx` via npm.\n\n\tnpm install sfx\n\nAnd require it in your program.\n\n```js\nvar sfx = require(\"sfx\");\n```\n\n### API\n`sfx` aims to provide a simple, consistent, cross-platformish API for your sound effects in your node programs.\n\n#### `sfx.play( sound [, volume, rate, callback] )`\nPlay a sound. `sound` is a path to a sound file or a name of sound file in the `sounds/` directory (without the extension). Specifiying \"random\" for the `sound` parameter plays a random sound from the library. `volume` is a number between 1-100. `rate` is the speed the sound effect is played at (experimental). And finally, `callback` is called on complete.\n\n```js\nsfx.play(\"/System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff\");\nsfx.play(\"ping\");\nsfx.play(\"ping\", 100);\n```\n\n#### `sfx.say( string [, voice, callback] )` (OSX only for now)\nUse text-to-speech to hear a string spoke aloud. `string` is the string to speak. `voice` is to specify a voice to speak with. Available voices (OSX only) are: Agnes, Albert, Alex, Bad News, Bahh, Bells, Boing, Bruce, Bubbles, Cellos, Deranged, Fred, Good News, Hysterical, Junior, Kathy, Pipe Organ, Princess, Ralph, Trinoids, Vicki, Victoria, Whisper, Zarvox and \"random\" to use a random voice.\n\n```js\nsfx.say(\"The human torch was denied a bank loan.\");\nsfx.say(\"The arsonist has oddly shaped feet.\", \"Hysterical\");\nsfx.say(\"The skeleton ran out of shampoo in the shower.\", \"random\");\n```\n\n#### `sfx.[sound]( [volume, rate] )`\t\nSounds in the library (without their extension) can also be called directly from the `sfx` for easy access. `sound` is the name of sound within the `sound/` library.\n\n```js\nsfx.ping();\nsfx.hero();\nsfx.random(); // Play a random sound\n```\n\n### Example uses\nUse `sfx` to read out your logs (but it's probably a bad idea).\n\n```js\nvar _log = console.log; \nconsole.log = function() { sfx.say(Array.prototype.join.call(arguments, \". \")); _log.apply(console, arguments); }\n```\n\nMake `sfx` dunk on an error.\n\n```js\ndb.on(\"error\", function(err) {\n\tsfx.funk(function() {\n\t\tthrow err;\t\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nHave a nice alert when your script is finished running.\n\n```js\noperation.on(\"complete\", function() {\n\tsfx.pop(function() {\n\t\tprocess.exit();\t\n\t})\n});\n```\n\nYour website's traffic is fading and every request is a good request so it should have a happy sound.\n\n```js\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n\tsfx.hero();\n});\n```\n\nGot any cool examples? Submit a pull request and I'd be happy to put it here.\n\n### Contributing\nHave a cool sound to contribute? Make sure it's less than 250kb, stick it in the `sounds/` directory and submit a pull request.\n\n### TODO\n* Add a little sound package manager hosted on Github so you can selectively retrieve sounds. `sfx add hooray` which adds the `hooray` sound to the global sfx sound directory. Sound files could get large and ain't nobody got time for that.\n\n### Licensing\nMIT\n\nThe sounds within the `sounds/` directory are the factory sounds provided in `/System/Library/Sounds` in OSX. I have no idea what the licensing on these sounds. If anyone can inform me of the license, it would be greatly appreciated.",
